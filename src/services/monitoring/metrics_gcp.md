    To chart or monitor metric types with values of type `STRING`, convert them into numeric-friendly signals at ingest time or expose the state as labels that PromQL can evaluate. Legacy MQL string-conversion functions are being retired, so avoid adding new dependencies on legacy `String` helpers.

The following list was last generated at 2025-03-06 15:20:27 UTC. For more information about this process, see [About the lists](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics#generated).
Metrics from [App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs). **Note:** If you use App Engine flexible environment in combination with Cloud Load Balancing, then certain metrics in the following table are reported as metrics from the [`loadbalancing` table](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-loadbalancing) instead. For more information, see [External Application Load Balancer logging and monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/https-logging-monitoring). Launch stages of these metrics: ALPHA BETA GA
Metrics from [Cloud Run functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs) that use the `cloudfunctions.googleapis.com` API (v1 or v2). (For functions that use the `run.googleapis.com` API, see the table of metrics at [`run`](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_gcp#gcp-run).) Launch stages of these metrics: ALPHA BETA GA
Metrics from [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs). For newer Kubernetes metrics, see the [`kubernetes.io` metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_kubernetes#kubernetes-kubernetes). Launch stages of these metrics: ALPHA
Metrics available to be collected by any [Google Cloud API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library) (resource type [`consumed_api`](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources#tag_consumed_api)) and by APIs you created by using [Cloud Endpoints](https://cloud.google.com/endpoints/docs) (resource type [`api`](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/resources#tag_api)). Note that not all Google Cloud APIs collect `serviceruntime` metrics.
